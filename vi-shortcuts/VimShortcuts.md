## üìù Introduction to Vi/Vim

### What is Vi/Vim?

**Vi** (Visual Editor) is a lightweight, powerful text editor pre-installed on nearly every Unix/Linux system. **Vim** (Vi IMproved) is its enhanced version, packed with modern features like syntax highlighting, plugins, and advanced scripting.

### Why Learn Vi/Vim? ü§î

- **Universal Availability**: Found on every Linux server, from cloud VMs to embedded systems. üåê
- **Efficiency**: Master keyboard shortcuts for blazing-fast editing. ‚ö°
- **DevOps Essential**: Perfect for editing configs (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) over SSH.
- **Powerful Features**: Search/replace, macros, and multi-file editing for complex tasks.
- **No Mouse Needed**: Fully keyboard-driven for minimal latency. üñÆ
- **Customizable**: Tailor it to your workflow with `.vimrc` and plugins.

### Opening Files

```bash
# Open file with Vim
vim config.conf

# Open with Vi (may point to Vim)
vi script.sh

# Open at specific line
vim +50 app.py  # Line 50
vim + app.py    # Last line

# Open multiple files
vim nginx.conf apache.conf

# Open in read-only mode
vim -R /etc/passwd
view /etc/passwd  # Same as vim -R

# Compare files with vimdiff
vimdiff old.conf new.conf
vim -d old.conf new.conf

# Create new file
vim new_script.sh
```

**Example**:
```bash
# Edit Nginx config on a server
ssh user@server
vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

**Pro Tip**: Use `vimtutor` to learn interactively:
```bash
vimtutor
```

## üé≠ Vi Modes

Vim‚Äôs power lies in its **modes**, which separate navigation, editing, and commands. Think of it as switching gears in a high-performance car! üöó

### 1. Normal Mode (Command Mode)
- **Default mode** when Vim starts.
- Used for navigation, copying, deleting, and executing commands.
- Return to Normal mode with `Esc` or `Ctrl+[`.

### 2. Insert Mode
- For typing and editing text.
- Enter from Normal mode:
  ```
  i    - Insert before cursor
  I    - Insert at line start
  a    - Append after cursor
  A    - Append at line end
  o    - New line below
  O    - New line above
  ```

### 3. Visual Mode
- For selecting text (like highlighting with a mouse).
- Enter from Normal mode:
  ```
  v    - Character-wise selection
  V    - Line-wise selection
  Ctrl+v - Block-wise selection (for columns)
  ```

### 4. Command-Line Mode
- For executing commands (e.g., save, quit, search).
- Enter from Normal mode:
  ```
  :    - Enter command-line mode
  /    - Search forward
  ?    - Search backward
  ```

### Mode Indicator
- Bottom left shows mode:
  - `-- INSERT --`: Insert mode
  - `-- VISUAL --`: Visual mode
  - `-- REPLACE --`: Replace mode
  - (No indicator): Normal mode

**Example**:
```bash
# Open Vim
vim test.txt
# Press i to enter Insert mode
# Type some text
# Press Esc to return to Normal mode
```

**Pro Tip**: If you‚Äôre lost, press `Esc` twice to ensure you‚Äôre in Normal mode.

### Character Movement
```
h    - Move left

W    - Next WORD start (space-separated)
e    - Next word end
E    - Next WORD end

```

**Example**:
```
# Text: The quick brown fox
# Cursor: |The quick brown fox
w    # -> The |quick brown fox
e    # -> The quic|k brown fox
b    # -> |The quick brown fox
```

### Line Movement
```
0    - Line start

```

### File Movement
```
gg   - First line
G    - Last line
:50  - Go to line 50
50G  - Go to line 50
50%  - Go to 50% of file
```

### Jumping
```
%    - Jump to matching bracket/parenthesis ({}, [], ())
{    - Previous paragraph
}    - Next paragraph
Ctrl+o - Previous location
Ctrl+i - Next location
''   - Last cursor position
'.   - Last change position
```

**Example**:
```bash
# Navigate a Python file
vim app.py
gg     # Go to file start
/ def  # Search for function definitions
n      # Next match
50G    # Jump to line 50
```

**Pro Tip**: Combine motions with counts (e.g., `3w` moves three words forward).
